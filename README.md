Title: Hotel Cancellation Analysis: Data Analysis Project using Pandas and Seaborn in Python

Description:

In this data analysis project, I have addressed the business problem of high cancellation rates in city hotels and resort hotels using Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn. The project focuses on analyzing historical hotel booking data to understand the factors contributing to high cancellation rates and providing actionable insights to improve revenue generation and operational efficiency.

The project begins by exploring and visualizing the dataset using Pandas and Seaborn, gaining insights into the data distribution, trends, and patterns. Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

Next, various data analysis techniques are employed to identify the factors influencing hotel cancellations. This  involve performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, such as analyzing booking patterns by month, day of the week, or customer segment. Statistical analysis may also be conducted to identify significant differences in cancellation rates among different hotel types, customer types, or booking channels using hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics.

The project may also involve identifying potential strategies and recommendations to reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue generation. This could include analyzing pricing strategies, booking policies, or customer engagement programs to incentivize customers to honor their bookings. Operational improvements, such as optimizing overbooking policies, enhancing customer service, or improving room allocation strategies, may also be suggested to minimize cancellations and maximize hotel room utilization.

The final outcome of the project may be presented in the form of visualizations, statistical summaries, and actionable recommendations for hotel management to implement strategies and address the high cancellation rates. This project showcases my proficiency in using Python libraries, such as Pandas and Seaborn, for data analysis, statistical modeling, and providing data-driven business insights to tackle real-world business problems.
